Learning on a Simulation
----------
Attempt at getting information from either FlightGear, which works but is a bit
slow, or crrcsim, which is fast but probably not all the required information.
Both connect from a Python program to the simulator over a port the simulator
opens.

crrcsim based on: [dronekit-sitl](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-sitl/tree/master/dronekit_sitl/pysim)  
FlightGear based on: [FlightGear Python example](http://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/flightgear/ci/ next/tree/scripts/python/FlightGear.py)
