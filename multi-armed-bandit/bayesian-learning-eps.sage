# Applying Bayesian Learning to The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
#
# Garrett Wilson
# October 30, 2015
#
# The goal of this simulation is to apply Bayesian learning to learning which
# levers to pull to get the most money.
#
# Let the random variables X_1, X_2, ... X_n be the amount of money you get
# each time you pull a particular lever. We will assume that these follow the
# Markov property with the new probability distribution only depending on the
# last probability distribution rather than all those before, i.e. X_n depends
# only on X_(n-1) rather than X_1, X_2, ... X_(n-1).
#
# We want this to be true since it'll simplify calculations. We will consider
# the simulation a success if it improves upon the results from applying the
# epsilon-greedy algorithm to the problem.
#
# We will assume that the amount of money gained per pull of a certain lever is
# a normal distribution with a certain standard deviation and mean. We want to
# learn this standard deviation but in particular the mean. Then we will pull
# the levers with the higher mean more often while at the same time becoming
# more confident about where that mean is.
#
# We will assume an initial uniform distribution from [0,max] where max is some
# reasonable maximum for how much each lever pull will give you, depends on
# currency unit.
#
# Note: We will also for the time being assume we know the standard deviation.
#
#
# What I learned:
#
#    I'm not really improving the results any. The Bayesian learning learns the
#    probability distribution. This doesn't tell us how we should explore the
#    levers though, so we still have to then use some decision-making algorithm
#    to determine what to do with these learned probability distributions.
#
#    For example, maybe classification really *is* what we need here. We want
#    to determine which of the levers is the best to pull based on our
#    distributions.
#
# Used the following slides to gain an understanding of how to do this:
